                <p>I was born and raised in NY, and my kids were born there. I taught sciences to girls, and loved it. But growth and change are the best part of life, right? Now we live in Israel, and I have a new career. How marvelous is that?</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My favorite hobbies are reading and working with wool.  I spin, dye, crochet, knit, and weave, sew clothes and recently started quilting for my grandkids. I like baking and canning, and trying new recipes. Never a dull moment!</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>A fun fact about me: I have a partner, a wonderful and brilliant service dog. He does everything from helping me get around to doing laundry, and is always happy to have a job to do. What a blessing service animals are!</p>
